# My Projects

Here are some of the projects I've been working on across finance, analytics, and large-scale data platforms. Each project reflects a focus on building reliable data systems that enable better decision-making at scale.

- [Finance Data Platform Modernization](#project-1-finance-data-platform-modernization)
- [Global Business Solutions Analytics Data Mart](#project-2-global-business-solutions-analytics-data-mart)
- [Customer Data Lake & Compliance Migration](#project-3-customer-data-lake--compliance-migration)

## Project 1: Finance Data Platform Modernization

I led the design and development of a SOX-compliant finance data platform supporting analytics, reporting, and decision-making across multiple business units. The platform consolidated fragmented financial data into a centralized AWS-based Data Lake and Warehouse, enabling self-service analytics while maintaining strict governance and audit requirements. By standardizing ingestion and orchestration workflows, the platform improved data reliability, reduced errors, and lowered cloud infrastructure costs.

This project was especially interesting because it balanced innovation with regulatory rigor—ensuring speed, scalability, and trust in financial data used for business-critical decisions.

**What I Learned**:
- How to design scalable, compliant financial data platforms under SOX and audit constraints  
- Translating finance and compliance requirements into reliable data architecture  
- Optimizing cloud costs while improving performance and data quality

## Project 2: Global Business Solutions Analytics Data Mart

I designed and implemented an analytics data mart to support procurement, travel, and expense reporting for global business teams. The project focused on building clean, well-modeled datasets that enabled analysts to self-serve insights without deep technical dependencies. By improving data accessibility and standardizing business logic, the solution reduced manual analysis time and improved consistency across reports.

This project highlighted the importance of strong data modeling and product thinking in analytics engineering.

**What I Learned**:
- Designing reusable data models (facts and dimensions) for analytics use cases  
- Partnering with non-technical stakeholders to define meaningful metrics  
- Enabling self-service analytics through thoughtful data abstractions

## Project 3: Customer Data Lake & Compliance Migration

I led the migration of sensitive customer data into a centralized, CCPA-compliant data lake supporting analytics for over 20 million users. The project involved building and optimizing distributed data pipelines for clickstream and product usage data, significantly improving processing throughput and data availability. I also implemented monitoring and alerting systems to improve operational reliability and reduce incident response times.

This work sat at the intersection of data engineering, privacy, and consumer trust—ensuring data could be leveraged responsibly at scale.

**What I Learned**:
- Designing privacy-aware data architectures aligned with regulatory requirements  
- Building and optimizing large-scale distributed pipelines using Spark and SQL  
- Improving data reliability through monitoring, alerting, and automation
